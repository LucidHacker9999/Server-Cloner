# Server-Cloner
Clones Servers, And Makes Them Yours!
I found it Usefull, So you can just copy the server in stead of just making one and taking hours.

How to use: 
Just Simply Go To Replit.com And Make a python Repl Then Just Copy the files to the repl and Put your user id in useridhere And Done. 
Run it And it will ask for a token Get your Token Then Get the Server you want to copy id And your server that you want the copy be in. 
Your All SetUp Now.
